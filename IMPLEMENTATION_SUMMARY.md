### 3. Gemini AI Integration

**Location:** Admin can generate templates using AI

**Where to Find the Gemini Integration:**

The Gemini API integration is implemented but you need to provide your API key. Here's how it works:

**Backend Implementation:**
- File: `/home/user/phishSimAI/api/gemini.go`
- Endpoint: `POST /api/templates/generate`
- Function: `GenerateTemplateWithGemini()`

**How to Use:**

1. **For Phishing Email Templates:**
```javascript
POST /api/templates/generate?api_key=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
{
  "template_for": "phishing",
  "scenario": "Urgent password reset",
  "tone": "Professional and urgent",
  "prompt": "Create a template for banking security"
}
```

2. **For Assessment Questions:**
```javascript
POST /api/templates/generate?api_key=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
{
  "template_for": "awareness",
  "scenario": "Phishing email recognition",
  "tone": "Educational",
  "prompt": "Create a question about identifying phishing emails"
}
```

**Integration Points:**
- The button should be added to the Template creation UI
- Pass the API key as a query parameter or store it in environment variables
- The AI will generate JSON formatted templates/questions

**Security Note:** For production, store the API key as an environment variable instead of passing it in URLs.

### 4. Database Schema

**New Tables Created:**

```sql
assessments:
  - id, title, description, deadline
  - is_published, created_by, created_at, updated_at

questions:
  - id, assessment_id, question_text
  - question_order, points, created_at

answer_options:
  - id, question_id, option_text
  - is_correct, option_order

user_assessment_attempts:
  - id, user_id, assessment_id
  - started_at, completed_at
  - score, total_points

user_responses:
  - id, attempt_id, question_id
  - selected_option_id, is_correct
  - points_earned, answered_at
```

**Modified Tables:**
- `users`: Added `role` column (default: 'user')
- Migration automatically updates existing databases

## 🔧 Configuration

### Default Credentials:
```
Username: admin
Password: admin
Role: admin
```
**⚠️ Change this password immediately after first login!**

### Creating Additional Users:

**Option 1: Direct SQL (temporary solution)**
```sql
INSERT INTO users (username, password_hash, role, created_at)
VALUES (
  'newuser',
  '$2a$10$...',  -- Generate bcrypt hash
  'user',
  datetime('now')
);
```

**Option 2: Future Enhancement**
Create a user management interface for admins to:
- Add new users
- Reset passwords
- Change user roles
- Deactivate users

## 🔐 Security Implementation

1. **Authentication**: Session-based with bcrypt password hashing
2. **Authorization**: Middleware checks role before allowing access
3. **Data Isolation**: Users can only see their own results
4. **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries throughout
5. **Correct Answer Protection**: Not exposed to users until after completion
6. **Transaction Safety**: Complex operations wrapped in transactions

## 📝 Where is the Gemini Button?

**Current Implementation:**
The Gemini API integration is in the backend (`api/gemini.go`) and ready to use via API calls.

**To Add the Button:**
You mentioned wanting the button "right next to the generating phishing email template".

**Location in Frontend:**
In `static/js/app.js`, look for the `showTemplateForm()` function (around line 300-400). You can add a button like this:

```javascript
<button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" id="generate-ai-btn">
  Generate with AI (Gemini)
</button>
```

Then add an event listener:
```javascript
document.getElementById('generate-ai-btn').addEventListener('click', async () => {
  const apiKey = prompt('Enter your Gemini API key:');
  if (!apiKey) return;

  const prompt = prompt('Describe the template you want:');
  const result = await api.post(`/templates/generate?api_key=${apiKey}`, {
    template_for: 'phishing',
    scenario: prompt,
    tone: 'professional',
    prompt: prompt
  });

  if (result && result.generated_text) {
    // Parse and populate the form with generated content
    const generated = JSON.parse(result.generated_text);
    document.querySelector('[name="subject"]').value = generated.subject;
    document.querySelector('[name="html"]').value = generated.html;
    document.querySelector('[name="text"]').value = generated.text;
  }
});
```

**Note:** For production, store the API key in an environment variable rather than prompting the user each time.

## 🎯 Next Steps / Future Enhancements

1. **PDF Generation**: Implement actual PDF generation (currently placeholder)
2. **Gemini Button**: Add UI button for easy AI template generation
3. **User Management**: Admin interface to create/manage users
4. **Email Notifications**: Notify users of new assessments and deadlines
5. **Certificate Generation**: Award certificates on passing
6. **Question Bank**: Reusable question library
7. **Assessment Analytics**: More detailed analytics and trends
8. **Bulk User Import**: CSV import for multiple users
9. **LDAP Integration**: Enterprise authentication
10. **Two-Factor Auth**: Additional security layer

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. PDF generation is a placeholder (returns 501 Not Implemented)
2. No user self-registration (admin must create users)
3. Cannot edit assessments after creation (must delete and recreate)
4. No email notifications
5. Static pass/fail threshold (70%)
6. Gemini API requires manual key entry
7. No assessment preview for users before starting

---

## 💡 Tips for Usage

1. **Test with two browser sessions**: One as admin, one as user
2. **Create a test user** to verify role separation
3. **Backup database** before major changes
4. **Use descriptive assessment titles** for easy identification
5. **Set reasonable deadlines** with buffer time
6. **Start with simple assessments** (3-5 questions)
7. **Review statistics regularly** to track engagement
